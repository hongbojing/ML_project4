# The basic process our group followed is:

1. Download the data set
2. Read in the data set
3. Split the data set into a training set, validation set, and testing set
4. Implement your algorithm
5. Training the model using the training set and your algorithm
6. Adjust the hyperparameters using the validation set (I suggest 5-fold cross validation)
7. Run your final model on the testing set to get a performance measure
8. Train and test your model using a machine learning API (e.g. scikit-learn)
9. Compare your performance measure with the performance measure from the machine learning API
10. Create a presentation to describe your work and summarize your results
